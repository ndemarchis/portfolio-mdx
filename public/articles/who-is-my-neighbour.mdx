When some describe the origins of Christianity, they speak of a Judaism
cleaved cleanly in two by the crucifixion of Jesus of Nazareth. They
spin a yarn of those who “believed in him” and those who did not.
However, when closely examining the events of the first century onwards,
the confusion, discord, and ideological diversity characteristic of
early Christianity means that scholars and laypeople alike should
carefully consider all aspects of the movement. As Jewish leaders of the
time had to contend with a growing ideological movement in their midst,
they, too, had to produce answers to these very same questions.

Early Christian leaders saw their twofold audience of Jews and Gentiles,
and incrementally adopted a tradition that welcomed both. More and more
Gentiles became interested in a faith that had the ability to bridge the
gap between two long-seperate groups. Instead of being an inherently
Jewish or anti-Jewish document, the texts that comprise the New
Testament serve to chart the path of a new vision for Judaism, in part
fulfilled by the life of Jesus of Nazareth. This “new Judaism” — both
hinted at through the gospels and exposed through Paul’s epistles —
reinforced fragmented, diverse early Christian churches and primarily
spoke to the issues of that day.

The sort of historical reductionism and revisionism characteristic of
some past and present Christian groups warrants a discussion of
Judaism’s early diversity. As historical evidence has become
increasingly important to explain the world into which Jesus came, the
aforementioned idea of a single unified rabbinic Judaism against a
single unified Christianity — at least among scholarly circles — “has
been shattered by the discovery of the Dead Sea scrolls and the
recognition of widespread Hellenistic influence on Jews in Palestine and
the Diaspora.” (Harrington, 126) Those documents increasingly revealed
the deep differences between early proto-Christian groups. The 27 books
of the New Testament, to put it another way, only represent a sliver of
the perspectives surrounding the different personas and roles for Jesus,
how to live the words of the Torah, and resulting implications for
Gentiles and Jews alike. Understanding that only “a fraction of the
early Christian writings came to be immortalized by inclusion in the
sacred canon” is vital in constructing an understanding of how the New
Testament is not inherently Jewish or anti-Jewish. (Ehrman _Lost Christianities_ 230)

One of the key distinctions to highlight are differing interpretations
of how to live out the words of the Torah (and later Tanakh) in several
groups preceding Jesus’ ministry. While many Bible-believing Christians
may use the terms Pharisees and Sadducees interchangeably, they
represented two sides of a near-political difference in perspective. The
former tended to be more “priestly” — that is, hereditarily enforcing
aspects of the Jewish law — while the latter tended to be more
“rabbinic” — that is, community-appointed leaders interpreting Mosaic
works. (Schwartz 616) Particularly with the “priestly” roles, those
differing interpretations would eventually create rifts as Judaism
spread beyond the walls of Jerusalem. The Torahic roles for the house of
Levi — priests and all those related to Temple practices — clearly
informed those Sadducees enjoying the exploits of their roles. In fact,
these Torah texts eventually would provide continual, if waning,
religious and political justification for the Sadducees.

However, there was not-insignificant opposition to the order of things
in the Jewish world. Qumran sects, “considering the Temple mismanaged
and the (Sadducean) priesthood corrupt, chose self-imposed exile and
accepted members only after a long novitiate.” (Schwartz 617) Some
scholars consider John the Baptist — self-described as precursor to one
“more powerful” than himself — informed by Qumran movements who insisted
upon a deliverance of the Temple. (<Bible>Mark 1:7</Bible>) That sort of questioning
would be vital to the development of later early Christian theology and
tradition, especially as Roman and other proto-Christian theologians
would describe their understanding of first century realities.

Public Jewish commentary of authorities and their teachings, to put it
another way, was increasingly characteristic of first century discourse.
So when purely considering the words of Jesus in conversation with
leading Jewish scriptural interpretations, it’s important to consider
that to “dispute the meaning of the Scripture, of course, is a very
Jewish and very rabbinic thing to do.” (Evans 30) The sheer amount of
scripture that Jesus spoke to — and modified to various degrees — goes
without saying. For instance, Jesus discusses how to follow Sabbath law
at several locations in John, as well as Luke and Mark. The latter
example (<Bible>Mark 2:23–28</Bible>) is particularly fascinating; where he still
tacitly supports the continued existence of the Sabbath, instead using
the platform to critique an extreme Sadducean interpretation (and,
arguably, interpolation) of Exodus’ Sabbath law. <Scripture>“Have you never read
what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need of
food?”</Scripture> (<Bible verse="Mark 2:25">v. 25</Bible>). The Sabbath law still need exist, he argues, but the
<Scripture>“sabbath was made for humankind... so the Son of Man is lord even of the sabbath.”</Scripture> 
(<Bible verse="Mark 2:27-28">vv. 27-28</Bible>) The act in question
— otherwise-permissibly plucking wheat from another’s field for food — serves as
an example of Jesus’ understanding of the law’s relation to human needs.

Further, Jesus’ expansion and explanation of Torahic concepts in Luke
speaks directly to pressing Jewish issues of that day. Directly
preaching against the Torah would not have had the same prominent
effects among his predominantly Jewish audiences. His measured
affirmation to the requirements of heavenly life in <Bible verse="Luke 10:27">10:27</Bible> — <Scripture>“You shall
love the Lord your God... and your neighbour as yourself”</Scripture> — “coheres
exegetically and thematically with Jewish interpretive tendencies.”
(Evans 33) To put it another way, it was a common message and a frequent
jumping-off point for rabbis and priests. However, the follower’s
follow-up of <Scripture>“who is my neighbour?”</Scripture> prompts a more critical answer. (<Bible verse="Luke 10:29">v. 29</Bible>)
Telling the famous parable of the Good Samaritan to illustrate his
point, a “priest” and “Levite” leave an assaulted traveler stranded on
the side of a road. (<Bible verse="Luke 10:32-33">vv. 32-33</Bible>) While one of the points of the story is
the importance of showing neighborly love, another subtler point
emphasizes the apparent hypocrisy of the Jewish leaders. In Jesus’ eyes,
the faith and practice that Jewish leaders preached flew in the face of
their observed faith and practice. In short, “Jesus’ teaching arose from
and spoke to the Jewish faith of his day.” (Evans 37)

Considering the context, though, these likely are rhetorical tools that
informed his ministry, not necessarily prescriptive statements about the
requirements of belief. Both of these examples — of the Sabbath and the
Good Samaritan — show that Jesus’ Jewish background, criticism of Jewish
authorities, and emphasis on Gentile teaching served to create more than
a Jewish or anti-Jewish faith. However, as Jesus’ crucifixion spurred
growth far beyond Jesus’ Jewish apostles to both Jews and Gentiles
throughout the Mediterranean, both faith leaders and congregations had
to increasingly answer the question of who the faith was for.

The first inklings of a unified “Christian” identity had to wait for the
Council of Jerusalem, some twenty years after Jesus’ death; even then,
disagreements indicated there would be emblematic of the next four
centuries of discourse. Some scholars emphasize a divide between Pauline
thinkers (who emphasized a Gentile-focused faith) and Jamesian and
Petrine thinkers (who leaned into Jesus’ Jewish-ness). The question of
circumcision, for instance, long a Jewish sign of the Abrahamic covenant
in <Bible>Genesis 17</Bible>, permeated the discussion in that Council. While the
Council eventually decided that <Scripture>“we should not trouble [with Jewish
customs] those Gentiles who are turning to God;”</Scripture> however, Pauline and
Jamesian thinkers may have achieved that conclusion for different
reasons. (<Bible>Acts 15:19</Bible>) Some argue that James believed “circumcision, the
generally-accepted mark of Jewish identity, would not be necessary for
Gentile converts; in fact, it would violate the hope expressed in the
prophetic tradition of Israelite dominion over the nations.” (Langston
131-32) Jews retained their Jewishness, in the eyes of James, while
Gentiles need not become Jewish as Christianity attracted new converts.

Paul’s enduring desire for a more universal, cohesive theology, however,
led him to reason out the question differently. As will be discussed
later, Paul’s personal conversion experience in <Bible>1 Cor. 15</Bible> likely served
as impetus to maintain the integrity of the faith from those who would
seek to contort it. Paul frequently defended himself against Gentiles
who expanded their theology beyond his intentions, while he
simultaneously “endeavored to free Christianity from the authority of
Judaism by seeking to break free from it.” (Langston 133) He wanted,
instead, to open the doors of the faith to more individuals; creating
something more Hellenistic, more palatable to Gentiles, and less
centralized to Jerusalem. As the faith expanded beyond its Jewish roots,
the Gentile church became an increasingly significant aspect of the
faith. The church was no longer a Jewish synonym for the faith, but
became more of a “common” faith accessible to all, regardless of
nationality. Yes, some early Christians “saw Jesus not as the founder of
a new religion that cast aside the old, but as the fulfillment of the
old, who brought something new to an understanding of God that was
already anticipated in the Hebrew Bible.” (Ehrman _Lost Christianities_
232-3) However, Paul also wanted to create a faith that would eventually
be able to stand alone, beyond the confines of contemporary Judaism.

Paul’s writings pioneered subversive ideas that were seminal in creating
religious practice that would expand Christianity beyond a Jewish
offshoot. Firstly, he expanded upon Jesus’ aforementioned idea of
priestly subversion of Jewish practice, particularly in the
understanding of the covenant and its implications. Especially in
Romans, Paul’s belief in common misinterpretations of the Torah becomes
abundantly clear: <Scripture>“‘Abraham believed God, and it was reckoned to him as
righteousness.’ <Verse>4</Verse>Now to one who works, wages are not reckoned as a gift
but as something due.”</Scripture> (<Bible>Romans 4:3-4</Bible>) He believed that Jewish leaders
interpreted the laws as a transaction — faithful Jews follow the
covenant, and become God’s people — instead of the laws being a gift
because Jews are God’s people. (Ehrman _Brief Introduction_ 216)

However, Paul did not only critique the Jewish leaders. Even in the
churches he founded, he repeatedly had to revile “dangerous ‘false
teachers’ propounding an understanding of the gospel that Paul finds
reprehensible or even damnable.” (Ehrman _Lost Christianities_ 177) Paul’s
continual promulgation of “correct” ideas against continual “apostasy”
would serve as a common theme for many of his letters. 1 Corinthians is
a prime example of this apostasy Paul repeatedly reviled. His sources
for the letter — Chloe in <Bible verse="1 Cor. 1:11">1:11</Bible> and three church members in <Bible verse="1 Cor. 16">ch. 16</Bible>,
depicted a congregation in dire straits. Reflective of earlier religious
traditions claiming to be from the school of thought of a famous
philosopher or theologian, he felt he must establish the “teaching”
vision of his role. In short, the priestly Jewish usurpation of vital
roles within the dissemination and vital interpretation of Torahic texts
meant Paul had to establish precedent in his line of thought. He argues
vehemently, for instance, against the idea that “wisdom and power
indicate the superior standing of those already... exalted” by Jesus’
teachings. (Ehrman _Brief Introduction_ 246) Those ideas characteristic of
those Sadducean and Pharisaic teachers that Paul rebels against (he was,
after all, a prominent member of the latter group) would serve to create
the core teachings of Christian theology later on. It pushes against
Jewish tendencies among some early Christian groups, that is, but does
not reject Judaism altogether as a component of such a diverse belief
system.

New Testament study often inspires deep, intense fascination. Study of
archaeology and manuscripts, texts and theology, historical
reconstruction and associated power dynamics, create a well of research
deep enough to exhaust a lifetime. However, many who encounter such
documents are deprived of an opportunity to recognize such depth.
Instead, the texts are recited as key verses from scripture, isolated
from historical and practical context to achieve specific theological
goals. They make quippy one-liners and home screen wallpapers. They are
splashed across billboards above adult film shops and protest signs at
the Supreme Court, tiny copies near-forced into the hands of students at
the intersection of 7th Street and Dent Drive.

That level of depth, for any number of reasons, escapes many, possibly
most who will read some subset of the text. Many of the misconceptions
associated with the New Testament (and the religious groups who derive
some or all of it as their scripture) can be alleviated simply with
dedicated close readings in the context of the original authors.

Is the New Testament Jewish? Is it not? Few would be able to give a
succinct answer; even fewer one in which they can take confidence. The New
Testament wasn’t written to answer a twenty-first century question of
distinction between two modern groups. It was intended to speak to the
Jews and Gentiles of the first-century Mediterranean about issues that
concerned them: the end of the world, the years-long Roman occupation,
persevering through a demoralizing class system, and, yes, the words of
the itinerant preacher Jesus of Nazareth.
